<p><i>With "JavaScript Advanced" students gain in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as advanced syntax, working with matrices, objects, classes, and advanced functions. Students will also study more complex concepts such as function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course will further develop their algorithmic thinking. After the successful completion of this course, the students will have the opportunity to work with the DOM tree, to manipulate it and to work with "events". The functional and OOP approaches to JavaScript programming will be reviewed and concepts such as inheritance, object composition and prototype chain will be studied.</i></p>
